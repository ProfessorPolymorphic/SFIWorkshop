    "text": "Case Study: Decision Support During a Pandemic Outbreak\nCAUTION This is a GPT-4 summary of the Group 3 discussion notes.\nThe brainstorming sessions have brought up several important considerations and recommendations for designing simulation games to support decision-making during pandemics:\n\nRole of Simulation Games: Simulation games serve as a risk-free environment to understand complex systems, allowing individuals to explore the outcomes of various decision-making strategies and actions. This helps in understanding the process, interactions, and the rationale behind certain decisions. Moreover, they could be used as tools to educate the audience about risks, generate various scenarios, and help decision-makers be aware of potential outcomes.\nAddressing Uncertainty: One of the most significant decision-making challenges during a pandemic is the uncertainty. The participants suggested that the games should help decision-makers take actions under uncertain conditions, get familiar with handling diverse models, and also enable them to make risk-based decisions. In this context, gaming can be utilized to help build a perspective around dealing with uncertainty, akin to how we approach weather forecasts.\nTrust and Perception: Games can be used to foster trust in models and methodologies used for decision-making, especially when those tools are from different regions or domains. They can also help in understanding the public’s reaction to various decisions, which is crucial in managing a crisis. Moreover, these games can help in building trust and shared understanding among decision-makers, which can subsequently improve collaboration.\nTraining and Preparedness: Games should be designed with specific learning objectives and intended to improve critical decision-making skills. Participants suggested that they should cater to various levels of hierarchy within decision-making structures, facilitating a mutual understanding of the complexities involved. Games can also be an excellent tool for preparedness, allowing individuals to learn from crisis situations without actual risk and understand the importance of investing in preparedness.\nGaps and Future Research: There’s a need to better understand how to design games that effectively communicate the importance of preparedness, engage participants, and lead to tangible changes in policy and behavior. Future research could focus on developing and evaluating games that incorporate realistic scenarios. Studying the mechanisms of behavior change in the context of games could provide valuable insights into designing more effective preparedness training tools.\n\nIn summary, simulation games hold a significant potential to help address the decision-making challenges in a pandemic. They can aid in tackling uncertainty, building trust, training for preparedness, and understanding public perception. However, more research is required to optimally design these games to translate game experiences into real-world policy changes and behaviors."

    "text": "RESULT\nGame Concept: “PandemiSim: Crisis Decision Simulator” is an immersive, interactive simulation game designed for high-level government officials to explore potential impacts of critical decisions during a global health crisis like a pandemic. The game models real-world systems and processes, and players are tasked with managing and mitigating the impacts of a fictional pandemic.\nGameplay: The game starts with the emergence of a novel infectious disease and players are placed in the position of top decision makers (e.g., Health Ministers, Finance Ministers, etc.) Each player is provided with a portfolio of decisions they can make, and the choices will affect various aspects of the pandemic (e.g., public health, economy, society).\nDecisions fall into categories such as public health interventions (vaccine research, lockdowns, mask mandates, testing and contact tracing), resource allocation (investments in healthcare infrastructure, economic relief funds), communication strategies, and international cooperation. Each decision comes with a cost, timeline, and potential impact on the course of the pandemic.\nThe game will present an array of possible actions and decisions, each of which has its pros and cons, as well as its own time-frame for implementation and potential impact. For instance, the decision to fund vaccine research might be costly and not show immediate results, but can have a significant long-term impact. Conversely, imposing a strict lockdown could have immediate effects but could lead to severe economic fallout.\nScenarios and Outcomes: The game evolves based on the decisions made by the players. Different scenarios play out, ranging from best to worst-case scenarios, depending on the policies implemented. The game employs a sophisticated algorithm to calculate the probable outcomes based on the decisions taken by the players, taking into account variables such as cost, public compliance, and unintended consequences.\nVisualizations and Feedback: After each decision is made and each scenario is run, players can “see” the projected outcome in terms of infection rates, mortality rates, economic impact, public sentiment, etc., presented through graphs and other visualizations. This immediate feedback loop helps players understand the potential impacts of their decisions and adjust their strategies accordingly.\nGoal: The goal of the game is not necessarily to “win” against the pandemic but to manage the crisis effectively while balancing the various factors at play. The game aims to equip government officials with a greater understanding of the complexities involved in decision-making during a crisis, the consequences of these decisions, and the importance of adaptability in the face of evolving threats.\n“PandemiSim: Crisis Decision Simulator” uses the power of simulation and gaming to provide a safe, yet realistic environment for decision-makers to experiment, learn, and gain insights into handling a real-world pandemic. Through this interactive platform, officials can understand the importance of their decisions and how they play a role in shaping the course of a global crisis."

    "title": "GAMES FOR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS",
    "section": "",
    "text": "CAUTION This is a GPT-4 summary of the Group 3 discussion notes.\n\n\nIn the early stages of a pandemic outbreak, one of the most critical components is situational awareness (SA) - understanding the nature of the threat, its potential trajectory, and impacts. A concrete SA challenge can be the spread of misinformation or a lack of data that can lead to ineffective responses and an exacerbation of the crisis.\n\n\n\nDevelop a crisis management simulation game that emphasizes the need for data collection, data accuracy, transparency, and interpretation. The game could put players in the shoes of public health officials, national leaders, and journalists, where they are faced with managing the outbreak, making decisions based on the information available, and communicating to the public.\nPlayers would deal with incomplete or non-curated data, the uncertainty of the data, misinformation, and the challenge of balancing the ratio of false positives and real positives. They would need to identify vulnerabilities for active surveillance, find indirect indicators of the outbreak’s progress, and understand how their actions affect the big picture.\nTo help players understand the complexities of SA during a pandemic outbreak, the game would provide feedback on the decisions made, emphasizing the implications of acting on inaccurate or incomplete information, and highlight the importance of data verification and transparency.\n\n\n\nBy using a gaming approach, we can help players understand the complexities and importance of SA during a crisis. This can lead to better decision-making processes and improved crisis management strategies, as well as a greater appreciation of the importance of data and information accuracy.\nFurthermore, the game could be used in training and education settings to improve the SA skills of those involved in public health, journalism, and leadership roles. It could also raise awareness among the general public about the challenges and importance of SA during a pandemic.\n\n\n\nOne of the main gaps in our understanding of ‘gaming for SA’ is the difficulty in creating games that account for different cultural, language, age, and professional backgrounds. This is particularly important as SA and decision-making processes can vary significantly across different cultures and professions.\nAdditionally, there is a lack of understanding of how group dynamics can impact SA and decision-making processes. There is a need for more research on this topic, particularly in the context of gaming.\nFuture research should also focus on improving our understanding of how misinformation and biases can impact SA. This could involve developing games that specifically focus on these issues, helping players to understand and overcome their biases and the impact of misinformation.\nIn conclusion, gaming is a promising approach to improving situational awareness. It offers a way to simulate real-world crises and challenges, helping players to understand and navigate complex scenarios, and learn from their decisions. With further research and development, gaming could play a vital role in preparing for future threats and crises."
