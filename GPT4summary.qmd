# [Case Study:]{.red} Situational Awareness during a Pandemic Outbreak

[CAUTION]{.red} This is a GPT-4 summary of the [Group 3 discussion notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwQjENZ7vvaONNoqZ1YW-1qE-QGNw14vVcMjAWRTqbQ/edit#).  

## Context:

In the early stages of a pandemic outbreak, one of the most critical components is situational awareness (SA) - understanding the nature of the threat, its potential trajectory, and impacts. A concrete SA challenge can be the spread of misinformation or a lack of data that can lead to ineffective responses and an exacerbation of the crisis.

## Proposed Gaming Approach:

Develop a crisis management simulation game that emphasizes the need for data collection, data accuracy, transparency, and interpretation. The game could put players in the shoes of public health officials, national leaders, and journalists, where they are faced with managing the outbreak, making decisions based on the information available, and communicating to the public.

Players would deal with incomplete or non-curated data, the uncertainty of the data, misinformation, and the challenge of balancing the ratio of false positives and real positives. They would need to identify vulnerabilities for active surveillance, find indirect indicators of the outbreak's progress, and understand how their actions affect the big picture.

To help players understand the complexities of SA during a pandemic outbreak, the game would provide feedback on the decisions made, emphasizing the implications of acting on inaccurate or incomplete information, and highlight the importance of data verification and transparency.

## Potential Impacts:

By using a gaming approach, we can help players understand the complexities and importance of SA during a crisis. This can lead to better decision-making processes and improved crisis management strategies, as well as a greater appreciation of the importance of data and information accuracy.

Furthermore, the game could be used in training and education settings to improve the SA skills of those involved in public health, journalism, and leadership roles. It could also raise awareness among the general public about the challenges and importance of SA during a pandemic.

## Gaps and Future Research Directions:

One of the main gaps in our understanding of 'gaming for SA' is the difficulty in creating games that account for different cultural, language, age, and professional backgrounds. This is particularly important as SA and decision-making processes can vary significantly across different cultures and professions.

Additionally, there is a lack of understanding of how group dynamics can impact SA and decision-making processes. There is a need for more research on this topic, particularly in the context of gaming.

Future research should also focus on improving our understanding of how misinformation and biases can impact SA. This could involve developing games that specifically focus on these issues, helping players to understand and overcome their biases and the impact of misinformation.

In conclusion, gaming is a promising approach to improving situational awareness. It offers a way to simulate real-world crises and challenges, helping players to understand and navigate complex scenarios, and learn from their decisions. With further research and development, gaming could play a vital role in preparing for future threats and crises.
