[CAUTION]{.red} This is a GPT 4 summary of [this group's notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOsiveDh_Tpcart2ikfYW5hp_h5WGVzifnPvjxsXVtk/edit#heading=h.3ch971jfdrn9).  Proceed with [insert funny quip here] ... 

The brainstorming session on SADM Challenge 3 centered around innovation through integration, with a focus on AI and complex system sciences for advancing gaming for pathogen threat readiness.

There were several propositions about how AI could improve decision-making in these games:

1. AI can generate ideas while preserving human judgment.
2. AI can enhance character development and nuances in the game.
3. AI can support game analysis.
4. AI actors could introduce unpredictable elements to the game, making it riskier and more realistic.
5. AI can handle primary analysis while humans provide support.

A significant discussion point was the difference between AI and hard-coded algorithms, with the challenge of making AI explain its reasoning.

A focus on complex systems science revealed the potential for using agent-based models and network models to create products for gaming, aiding adjudicators in their tasks.

Considering the 'case studies' approach, three phases were identified: pre-crisis, in-crisis, and post-crisis. Each phase brings unique challenges and benefits to the gaming design.

Repetition of games was discussed as a way to improve results, reducing costs and gradually integrating AI components.

The use of eye-tracking technology and voice recorders was suggested, but concerns about privacy and ethical issues related to human subjects were raised.

A proposal for an AI-driven immersive environment was discussed. However, it was recommended to start simple, considering the goal of the game, and gradually increase complexity.

There was a focus on developing games suitable for different levels of CDC employees: a simple game to educate all employees and a more complex, multiday game for management to simulate real-world crisis situations.

Overall, the emphasis was on creating an adaptable gaming environment that mimics the complexities and uncertainties of real-world decision-making, with the help of AI and complex system models. The game should not be overly reliant on graphical sophistication but focus more on the mechanics and its capacity to deliver a valuable learning experience.

One suggestion involved using AI to model and predict community responses to measures, to aid decision-making during a pandemic scenario.

The potential for using games to research, understand and influence private sector responses to a crisis was highlighted. For example, understanding levers to encourage increased production during a crisis was discussed as a key aspect of pandemic preparedness.

Finally, the idea of an AI or simulation acting as the 'virus' in a game was suggested, adding a dynamic and unpredictable element to the gaming experience.
