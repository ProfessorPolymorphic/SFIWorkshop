[Group 3 Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwQjENZ7vvaONNoqZ1YW-1qE-QGNw14vVcMjAWRTqbQ/edit#heading=h.vsg4onhlh4b1)

## **Brainstorming Session 1:** SADM Challenge 1 - Situational Awareness

1.  What are the greatest situational awareness (SA) challenges we face as we 'get ready for' future threats? Think about all stages, from SA today to SA during the earliest stages of emergence to SA in the heat of the battle to SA as the threat recedes.

2.  How can simulation games (and other forms of exercising/gaming) help address these challenges?

3.  What are gaps in our understanding of and ability to advance 'gaming for SA'?

4.  What are promising research directions to close those gaps? Perhaps start or end with articulating a particular 'case study' -- a concrete SA challenge (at any stage or scale of a threat) with a proposed gaming approach.

## **Brainstorming Session 2:** SADM Challenge 2 - Games to Advance Decision Making Under Uncertainty

1.  What are the greatest decision making (DM) challenges we face as we 'get ready for' future threats? Think about all stages, from DM today to DM during the earliest stages of emergence to DM in the heat of the battle to DM as the threat recedes.

2.  How can simulation games (and other forms of exercising/gaming) help address these challenges?

3.  What are gaps in our understanding of and ability to advance 'gaming for DM'?

4.  What are promising research directions to close those gaps? Start with a round table: Each person shares a poignant DM challenge from COVID and thoughts on how games/exercises prior to COVID might have helped

5.  End with a case study: As a group, select a concrete DM challenge (at any stage or scale of a threat) with a proposed gaming approach.

[GPT4 Summary for Group 3](DecisionsGPT4Group3.qmd)

[PandemiSim: Crisis Decision Simulator](Pandemisim.qmd) is a GPT4 generated game idea based on the notes and summary from the group 3 discussion.

## **Brainstorming Session 3:** SADM Challenge 3 - Innovating Through Integration

1. Start with a deep dive into one of your case studies. How might we use complex systems theory, models, or other approaches to design an effective game? How might we use AI?

2. How can we use ideas and tools from complex systems science to advance gaming for pathogen threat readiness?

3. How can we use AI to advance gaming for pathogen threat readiness?

4. How can games help us to navigate the challenges and opportunities of AI with respect to pathogen threat readiness?

5. End with a wrap-up and plan for your group report out.
