Proceed with trepidation….\nSADM Challenge 3 - Innovating Through Integration Summary\nOur brainstorming session for SADM Challenge 3 focused on exploring the use of complex systems theory, AI, and games to navigate the challenges and opportunities for pathogen threat readiness.\nOur main case study centered around a game designed to identify vulnerable populations for novel/emerging pathogens, utilizing agent-based models (ABMs) of cities. We discussed the complexity of epidemiological models, their potential benefits and challenges, and the principles we could derive from generalized models for more detailed simulations. A significant point of discussion was the understanding and anticipation of novel behaviors and vulnerabilities.\nOne crucial facet of this is understanding the definitions and axes of ‘vulnerability’, along with the impact of policy decisions on vulnerable populations. Emphasis was placed on the need for games to train in probability and stochastic scenarios, stressing the importance of situational awareness in differing real and perceived landscapes of vulnerability. Another discussed point was the application of AI to recognize decision-making patterns and provide dynamic feedback to reduce vulnerability.\nWe also discussed games designed to determine the best decision-making team, including AI-generated interlocutors for creating diverse decision-making perspectives and experimental design considerations for testing decision-making robustness.\nAI’s role in threat response was also a key point, from decision support to misinformation campaigns. We addressed the potential risks and benefits, such as AI’s possible erosion of public trust and its use in pharmaceutical interventions. It was also acknowledged that a balance must be struck between reliance on AI models and human decision-making, particularly in unforeseen scenarios.\nThe session concluded with points for our group’s ambassador, Linda, emphasizing the importance of translation post-game experience, understanding players’ motivations, developing decision-support tools, and exploring how gaming can aid in decision-making under uncertainty and high-dimensional information. It was noted that adaptivity is crucial, which could be an application area for AI.\nIn sum, the session underscored the potential of integrating complex systems theory, AI, and gaming to improve preparedness for pathogen threats."

We developed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) that represented different stakeholders in a pathogen outbreak scenario - health officials, nursing staff, the general public, and others. Each agent was designed to mimic real-world behavior, allowing for dynamic and emergent gameplay.\nWe also used an evolutionary algorithm to generate a broad range of possible pathogen threat scenarios, each with varying degrees of complexity and uncertainty. AI was trained on a diverse set of data to account for different responses and outcomes, providing players with a wide range of potential scenarios to navigate.\nApplication:\nThe game was designed to run various scenarios, from the initial detection of a pathogen to managing its spread and dealing with the aftermath. A particular focus was placed on non-pharmaceutical interventions and logistical challenges, such as testing and supply chain management. The AI would offer guidance, provide insights based on past data, and challenge players with hypothetical situations to prompt critical thinking and decision-making.\nOutcomes and Lessons Learned:\nUpon implementation, the AI-driven game was found to be an effective tool in fostering pathogen threat readiness. Users reported that the game’s dynamic and realistic scenarios encouraged critical thinking, helped identify blind spots in their approaches, and provided a comprehensive understanding of managing pathogen threats.\nThe game also underscored the importance of including diverse perspectives and handling uncertainty in decision-making. The use of AI and complex systems science allowed for the integration of these factors in a seamless, engaging manner.\nFuture Directions:\nThis project demonstrated the potential of AI in advancing gaming for pathogen threat readiness. Future work could further refine the AI, incorporating more sophisticated models of human behavior and a broader range of potential scenarios. Another area of interest could be the development of an AI capable of generating entirely novel scenarios, pushing the boundaries of human imagination and readiness.\nConclusion:\nThe use of AI in gaming for pathogen threat readiness offers promising avenues for training decision-makers in handling complex, uncertain scenarios. By creating dynamic, realistic, and engaging simulations, we can better prepare for future threats and enhance our capacity to respond effectively."

    "text": "RESULT\nIn the year 2030, the world once again found itself grappling with a new pandemic. It originated from a remote region of the Amazon Rainforest where unique and unexplored biodiversity thrived. Scientists named the virus “Xenopathogen-7” or XP-7 for short. Unlike the pandemics of the past, XP-7 was not just a single pathogen but a complex organism that encompassed various viral entities within its structure.\nXP-7 spread quickly and caused a variety of symptoms that spanned from mild to severe, which made it initially challenging to diagnose. However, the pandemic began to take an unexpected twist as researchers discovered something unusual about the virus’ replication mechanism.\nIn most viruses known to mankind, replication follows a set pattern where the virus invades a host cell, takes over the cell machinery, replicates, and then bursts the cell to spread to other cells. But XP-7 was unique. Instead of following this pattern, the virus engaged in a process of “Constructive Infection,” a term coined by scientists to describe this unprecedented phenomenon. This process had a striking resemblance to the fictional concept of “Assimilation” seen in science fiction, such as the Borg from Star Trek.\nUpon infection, XP-7 didn’t kill the host cells. Instead, it integrated its genetic material into the host DNA without causing immediate harm, similar to the way retroviruses work but far more efficiently and selectively. This effectively made the host cell a carrier of the virus, allowing it to spread more stealthily and evade the immune system.\nThe most unsettling part was that XP-7 seemed to assimilate more than just physical traits. Infected individuals started showing signs of heightened mental capabilities, improved memory, and a deep sense of collective consciousness, suggesting that XP-7 was influencing neurological functions as well.\nThe world was facing a pandemic unlike any other. The virus was not only causing physical harm but was also altering the very nature of human cognition and social interaction. While some heralded this as the next stage of human evolution, others feared the loss of individuality and free will.\nGovernments and international health organizations quickly mobilized efforts to combat the pandemic. Scientists worldwide worked tirelessly to unravel the mysterious biology of XP-7 and find a solution. In the meantime, society had to adapt to a new reality, where the line between individual and collective consciousness was increasingly blurred.\nWhile the concept of constructive infection and collective consciousness was fascinating, it posed ethical and existential questions, much like those explored in science fiction. This pandemic was a stern reminder that truth can sometimes be stranger than fiction."

This group would consist not only of virologists, epidemiologists, and healthcare professionals but also bioethicists, neurologists, sociologists, and experts in law and privacy rights. The task force would be responsible for understanding the virus’s effects, advising on containment strategies, and providing guidance on dealing with the virus’s sociological and ethical implications.\nPublic Information and Transparency: The government would need to launch a campaign to keep the public informed about the virus and its unusual effects. This would be crucial to prevent panic and misinformation, which could lead to further social destabilization. The campaign would aim to explain in understandable terms what is known about the virus, the symptoms to look out for, the current state of research, and steps that individuals can take to protect themselves. As the virus affects cognition and social interaction, providing resources for mental health support would also be important.\nInternational Collaboration and Research Funding: In the face of such an unprecedented pandemic, global cooperation would be critical. The US government would need to collaborate closely with other countries and international health organizations like the WHO to share research, data, and resources. Simultaneously, the government would need to dramatically increase funding for research into understanding the virus, developing tests, and creating treatments or a potential vaccine. This would likely involve partnerships with universities, research institutions, and private biotech companies. Additionally, resources would need to be put into studying the long-term effects of the virus on individuals and society.\n\nThis unusual situation would test the flexibility, creativity, and resilience of the nation, demanding innovative solutions for a problem that combines elements of biological science, neurology, and social science."

Proceed with appropriate fear of our robot overlords…\nThis brainstorming session focused on the challenges and opportunities of using gaming and simulations to improve situational awareness (SA) for future threats, particularly public health threats.\nThe greatest SA challenges identified include: - Data collection issues, especially cross-jurisdictionally and internationally. - Decisions makers need tools to understand and explore a range of possibilities given limited data. - Political factors influencing what information and actions are acceptable. - Time lag for results from implemented interventions. - Communicating uncertainty effectively.\nThe group considered simulation games as a method to help decision-makers understand these complexities and make informed decisions. However, the group also recognized potential pitfalls: - The game mechanics mustn’t appear trivial or childish. - Decision-makers can’t do everything simultaneously in real life; the game needs to reflect this constraint. - Games can be oversaturated with details, leading to an “unplayable monstrosity.” - The game must provide decision-makers with the necessary information about current situations, available options, and the trade-offs of these decisions. - Games must include the sociopolitical context and possible reactions, including public backlash and political repercussions.\nPromising research directions to close these gaps include: - Developing case studies, such as one around a new respiratory virus in a data-poor environment, to guide the game development. - Designing the game to progress over time, possibly with different stages or vignettes representing different points in a threat’s evolution. - Incorporating different perspectives to enhance understanding. - Exploring the “blame game,” including how to depersonalize blame. - Focusing on specific scenarios, like travel restrictions or economic consequences, to narrow down game mechanics.\nTo make the game more effective and accessible, it should: - Be playable within a reasonable time frame (suggested 3 hours) and without a steep learning curve. - Use a mix of real-world and fictional scenarios to prevent “gaming the past.” - Balance realism with playability to avoid trivializing the subject matter. - Incorporate new technologies and interventions as they become available.\nAdditionally, ongoing learning and adaption are needed to keep the game relevant and to ensure the valuable insights from past games aren’t lost. The UK Ministry of Defense’s efforts to develop this type of tool across their government is cited as a potential model."

This challenge requires policymakers to make complex decisions about social restrictions, healthcare resource allocation, and communication strategies, all of which are highly dependent on having accurate situational awareness.\n\nStage 1 - Pre-Emergence Situational Awareness: In the early stages, the focus should be on gathering information from various sources, including scientists, healthcare providers, and other experts. At this stage, simulation games could be used to help policymakers understand how a disease might spread and what measures could be effective in mitigating its impacts. These games could help policymakers understand the importance of gathering data quickly, recognizing potential threats, and making informed decisions.\nStage 2 - Emergence Situational Awareness: Once the disease has emerged, the focus shifts to understanding the current state of the disease’s spread and the effectiveness of measures taken to combat it. Here, the use of simulation games could assist policymakers in visualizing various scenarios, understanding the effects of different decisions, and training to react effectively in a rapidly changing situation.\nStage 3 - Heat of the Battle Situational Awareness: In the heat of a pandemic, it’s crucial to maintain awareness of the current state of disease spread, public sentiment and compliance with restrictions, healthcare resource utilization, and more. At this stage, simulation games could help to provide a space for practicing decision-making under pressure, dealing with unexpected challenges, and developing strategies for maintaining effective communication in a crisis.\nStage 4 - Post-Threat Situational Awareness: After the threat has receded, the focus should be on understanding the effects of decisions made during the crisis, identifying areas of improvement, and preparing for future threats. Simulation games could be particularly useful at this stage for conducting a “post-mortem” analysis, identifying gaps in the response, and preparing for future crises.\n\nIn terms of gaps in our understanding, there is a need for research into how games can best be designed to improve situational awareness, how often they need to be played to be effective, and how the lessons learned from games can best be translated into real-world decision-making.\nPromising research directions could include studies on the effectiveness of different game designs, exploration of the use of virtual and augmented reality in gaming for situational awareness, and the development of games tailored to specific challenges or decision-making contexts.\nThis case study illustrates how games and simulations can play a vital role in enhancing situational awareness at all stages of a public health crisis, from early detection to post-crisis evaluation. By helping policymakers to better understand and respond to complex and rapidly changing situations, these tools can significantly enhance our ability to manage and mitigate future threats."

Proceed appropriately.\nThe discussion focuses on the challenges and solutions related to situational awareness (SA) in handling future threats. SA refers to understanding the current state of affairs to make informed decisions, especially during crises like pandemics. The challenges span from the type and amount of information given to game participants to the level of data trust, interpretation and expertise, and the impact of cognitive overload on decision-making.\nThese challenges highlight the importance of data’s Four Vs: Velocity, Veracity, Volume, and Variety. In addition, it’s critical to balance between providing enough information to allow decision-making and withholding some to simulate the reality of incomplete data in real-world scenarios.\nSimulation games provide a way to train individuals in making effective decisions under such circumstances. They allow the modeling of uncertainty and unfamiliar situations to improve people’s agility and comfort in decision-making.\nGaps in our understanding of ‘gaming for SA’ include the development of a taxonomy of decision-makers across scales and the ability to track personal data assimilation during gameplay. Another gap is defining the public in these situations and understanding the various decision-making entities’ roles.\nThe discussion reflects on the idea of using gaming to identify what data we need, who needs to interpret it, and what kind of decisions are likely to be made under potential threats. Gaming could help in identifying objectives, making policies, and understanding public perception.\nThe discussion ends with a proposed case-study challenge: “Help policymakers gain situational awareness about public perceptions of a threat” in the context of a new pandemic. Policymakers need to understand public sentiment about measures like mask use, school closures, and testing strategies. These insights help in making decisions that are effective and acceptable to the public."

This group includes doctors, nurses, paramedics, lab technicians, and others involved directly in patient care. This is crucial to prevent potential spread within healthcare facilities and to protect those on the front lines.\nHigh-Risk Patients (60 tests): Approximately 30% of the tests could be dedicated to high-risk patients. This group includes people with symptoms of the pathogen, especially those with comorbidities like heart disease, diabetes, or immune disorders, and the elderly.\nClose Contacts of Confirmed Cases (40 tests): Another 20% of tests could be used for individuals who have had close contact with confirmed cases, to break the chain of transmission early.\nEssential Service Workers (30 tests): About 15% of the tests could be allocated to essential service workers, including police, firefighters, utility workers, and those involved in food and goods supply chains, as they have higher exposure due to their work.\nRandom Sampling of the General Population (30 tests): The remaining 15% of tests could be used for random sampling of the general population. This is important to understand the spread and prevalence of the pathogen in the community, which can guide containment and mitigation strategies.\n\nThis strategy can be fine-tuned based on the specific characteristics of the pathogen, including its mode of transmission, severity, prevalence in different age groups, and so on. The ultimate goal should be to contain the spread of the disease, protect the most vulnerable, and gather data for informed decision-making."

Here’s a potential distribution of responses:\n\nFocus on the Symptomatic (30 officials): These officials decide to administer tests primarily to those displaying symptoms of the disease. They believe that detecting and isolating symptomatic cases will have the most immediate impact on slowing transmission.\nPrioritize Healthcare Workers (25 officials): A quarter of the officials choose to administer tests mainly to healthcare workers, focusing on protecting the healthcare system’s capacity and limiting potential hospital-based spread.\nTarget High-Risk Individuals (20 officials): These officials decide to focus on testing the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. They consider these groups most at risk for severe disease and prioritize catching these cases early.\nTest Close Contacts (15 officials): These officials believe that testing individuals who have been in close contact with confirmed cases is the best way to prevent further spread.\nRandom Population Sampling (10 officials): A smaller number of officials decide to use their tests for random population sampling. They hope to gain a better understanding of the disease’s prevalence and spread in the community, even if this means potentially missing some symptomatic or high-risk cases.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, it would be critical to eventually establish a unified testing strategy to ensure efficient use of resources and minimize the potential for overlooking critical cases or areas of spread."

In this case, you have to make a strategic decision on how to best use the 25 tests you’ve received. Given the vulnerability of your residents, it would be advisable to prioritize them but also consider the staff that are in close contact with them.\nHere’s a potential distribution of the tests:\n\nSymptomatic Individuals (10 tests): Whether staff or resident, if anyone is showing symptoms of the disease, they should be immediately isolated and tested. Let’s assume there are 10 such individuals, including both residents and staff.\nStaff Members (7 tests): After testing symptomatic individuals, you could use a portion of the remaining tests on staff members. As they are the ones going in and out of the facility and interacting with the residents, it is essential to ensure they are not inadvertently spreading the disease. You could prioritize staff members who are in close contact with many residents, such as nurses, caregivers, and food service workers.\nHigh-Risk Residents (8 tests): Among the asymptomatic residents, prioritize those who are at a higher risk due to age or underlying health conditions for the remaining tests. Even though they are not showing symptoms, they are the ones likely to suffer the most severe outcomes if infected.\n\nThis leaves you with no more tests, and it is vital to request additional tests from health authorities, given the high-risk environment of a nursing home. Also, the implementation of strong preventive measures, such as proper sanitation, use of personal protective equipment, monitoring for symptoms, and limiting visitors, would be crucial to protect both residents and staff."

    "text": "RESULT\nGame Concept: “PandemiSim: Crisis Decision Simulator” is an immersive, interactive simulation game designed for high-level government officials to explore potential impacts of critical decisions during a global health crisis like a pandemic. The game models real-world systems and processes, and players are tasked with managing and mitigating the impacts of a fictional pandemic.\nGameplay: The game starts with the emergence of a novel infectious disease and players are placed in the position of top decision makers (e.g., Health Ministers, Finance Ministers, etc.) Each player is provided with a portfolio of decisions they can make, and the choices will affect various aspects of the pandemic (e.g., public health, economy, society).\nDecisions fall into categories such as public health interventions (vaccine research, lockdowns, mask mandates, testing and contact tracing), resource allocation (investments in healthcare infrastructure, economic relief funds), communication strategies, and international cooperation. Each decision comes with a cost, timeline, and potential impact on the course of the pandemic.\nThe game will present an array of possible actions and decisions, each of which has its pros and cons, as well as its own time-frame for implementation and potential impact. For instance, the decision to fund vaccine research might be costly and not show immediate results, but can have a significant long-term impact. Conversely, imposing a strict lockdown could have immediate effects but could lead to severe economic fallout.\nScenarios and Outcomes: The game evolves based on the decisions made by the players. Different scenarios play out, ranging from best to worst-case scenarios, depending on the policies implemented. The game employs a sophisticated algorithm to calculate the probable outcomes based on the decisions taken by the players, taking into account variables such as cost, public compliance, and unintended consequences.\nVisualizations and Feedback: After each decision is made and each scenario is run, players can “see” the projected outcome in terms of infection rates, mortality rates, economic impact, public sentiment, etc., presented through graphs and other visualizations. This immediate feedback loop helps players understand the potential impacts of their decisions and adjust their strategies accordingly.\nGoal: The goal of the game is not necessarily to “win” against the pandemic but to manage the crisis effectively while balancing the various factors at play. The game aims to equip government officials with a greater understanding of the complexities involved in decision-making during a crisis, the consequences of these decisions, and the importance of adaptability in the face of evolving threats.\n“PandemiSim: Crisis Decision Simulator” uses the power of simulation and gaming to provide a safe, yet realistic environment for decision-makers to experiment, learn, and gain insights into handling a real-world pandemic. Through this interactive platform, officials can understand the importance of their decisions and how they play a role in shaping the course of a global crisis."

    "title": "GAMES FOR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS",
    "section": "",
    "text": "CAUTION This is a GPT-4 summary of the Group 3 discussion notes.\n\n\nIn the early stages of a pandemic outbreak, one of the most critical components is situational awareness (SA) - understanding the nature of the threat, its potential trajectory, and impacts. A concrete SA challenge can be the spread of misinformation or a lack of data that can lead to ineffective responses and an exacerbation of the crisis.\n\n\n\nDevelop a crisis management simulation game that emphasizes the need for data collection, data accuracy, transparency, and interpretation. The game could put players in the shoes of public health officials, national leaders, and journalists, where they are faced with managing the outbreak, making decisions based on the information available, and communicating to the public.\nPlayers would deal with incomplete or non-curated data, the uncertainty of the data, misinformation, and the challenge of balancing the ratio of false positives and real positives. They would need to identify vulnerabilities for active surveillance, find indirect indicators of the outbreak’s progress, and understand how their actions affect the big picture.\nTo help players understand the complexities of SA during a pandemic outbreak, the game would provide feedback on the decisions made, emphasizing the implications of acting on inaccurate or incomplete information, and highlight the importance of data verification and transparency.\n\n\n\nBy using a gaming approach, we can help players understand the complexities and importance of SA during a crisis. This can lead to better decision-making processes and improved crisis management strategies, as well as a greater appreciation of the importance of data and information accuracy.\nFurthermore, the game could be used in training and education settings to improve the SA skills of those involved in public health, journalism, and leadership roles. It could also raise awareness among the general public about the challenges and importance of SA during a pandemic.\n\n\n\nOne of the main gaps in our understanding of ‘gaming for SA’ is the difficulty in creating games that account for different cultural, language, age, and professional backgrounds. This is particularly important as SA and decision-making processes can vary significantly across different cultures and professions.\nAdditionally, there is a lack of understanding of how group dynamics can impact SA and decision-making processes. There is a need for more research on this topic, particularly in the context of gaming.\nFuture research should also focus on improving our understanding of how misinformation and biases can impact SA. This could involve developing games that specifically focus on these issues, helping players to understand and overcome their biases and the impact of misinformation.\nIn conclusion, gaming is a promising approach to improving situational awareness. It offers a way to simulate real-world crises and challenges, helping players to understand and navigate complex scenarios, and learn from their decisions. With further research and development, gaming could play a vital role in preparing for future threats and crises."
