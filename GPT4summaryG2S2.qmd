[CAUTION]{.red} This is a GPT 4 summary of [this group's notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOsiveDh_Tpcart2ikfYW5hp_h5WGVzifnPvjxsXVtk/edit#heading=h.3ch971jfdrn9).  Proceed with abject terror... 

Based on the brainstorming session for the SADM Challenge 2 - Games to Advance Decision Making Under Uncertainty, the following main points emerge:

1. **Decision-making in crises**: The discussion examined decision-making during different stages of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It identified the role of modeling and data in these decisions, the challenges in communicating changes in guidance to the public, and the effect of political pressure on decision-making. 

2. **The role of gaming in decision-making**: The group explored the potential for gaming and simulations to improve decision-making under uncertainty. Gaming could simulate the real-world impact of various choices, helping decision-makers understand the potential consequences of their actions. These simulations could also highlight the importance of contingencies, such as the availability of resources like masks and tests.

3. **Gaps in gaming for decision-making**: Despite the potential benefits, there are several challenges in using games for decision-making. These include identifying the assumptions underlying a game, ensuring that the game does not mislead players, and dealing with the limitations of modeling complex systems.

4. **Research directions**: The conversation suggested several promising areas for future research. These included improving the realism of games, integrating the social and political aspects of decision-making into simulations, and studying how playing games changes people's behavior.

5. **Case study**: The group discussed a potential case study on decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This case would involve a concrete decision-making challenge, like whether to allow a large public event during a surge in cases, and how a gaming approach could have helped guide this decision.

6. **Educating the public**: A recurrent theme in the conversation was the importance of building trust and literacy in public health among the general population. Games could play a role in this by engaging the public in a fun and accessible way, and by showing them the complexity of public health decisions.

7. **Gaming in the future**: The team acknowledged the potential value of incorporating gaming into future crisis preparedness efforts. This could involve maintaining a state of readiness through regular exercises and games, improving public health literacy, and preparing for potential future threats.

The group ended the discussion by expressing interest in reviewing the forthcoming Defense Influence War Gaming Handbook.
