As a case study, we could examine the public health challenge of managing a new pandemic disease, for instance. This challenge requires policymakers to make complex decisions about social restrictions, healthcare resource allocation, and communication strategies, all of which are highly dependent on having accurate situational awareness.

1. **Stage 1 - Pre-Emergence Situational Awareness:** In the early stages, the focus should be on gathering information from various sources, including scientists, healthcare providers, and other experts. At this stage, simulation games could be used to help policymakers understand how a disease might spread and what measures could be effective in mitigating its impacts. These games could help policymakers understand the importance of gathering data quickly, recognizing potential threats, and making informed decisions.

2. **Stage 2 - Emergence Situational Awareness:** Once the disease has emerged, the focus shifts to understanding the current state of the disease's spread and the effectiveness of measures taken to combat it. Here, the use of simulation games could assist policymakers in visualizing various scenarios, understanding the effects of different decisions, and training to react effectively in a rapidly changing situation.

3. **Stage 3 - Heat of the Battle Situational Awareness:** In the heat of a pandemic, it's crucial to maintain awareness of the current state of disease spread, public sentiment and compliance with restrictions, healthcare resource utilization, and more. At this stage, simulation games could help to provide a space for practicing decision-making under pressure, dealing with unexpected challenges, and developing strategies for maintaining effective communication in a crisis.

4. **Stage 4 - Post-Threat Situational Awareness:** After the threat has receded, the focus should be on understanding the effects of decisions made during the crisis, identifying areas of improvement, and preparing for future threats. Simulation games could be particularly useful at this stage for conducting a "post-mortem" analysis, identifying gaps in the response, and preparing for future crises.

In terms of gaps in our understanding, there is a need for research into how games can best be designed to improve situational awareness, how often they need to be played to be effective, and how the lessons learned from games can best be translated into real-world decision-making.

Promising research directions could include studies on the effectiveness of different game designs, exploration of the use of virtual and augmented reality in gaming for situational awareness, and the development of games tailored to specific challenges or decision-making contexts.

This case study illustrates how games and simulations can play a vital role in enhancing situational awareness at all stages of a public health crisis, from early detection to post-crisis evaluation. By helping policymakers to better understand and respond to complex and rapidly changing situations, these tools can significantly enhance our ability to manage and mitigate future threats.
