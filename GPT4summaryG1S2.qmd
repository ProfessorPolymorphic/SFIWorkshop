Brainstorming Session 2: SADM Challenge 2 - Games to Advance Decision Making Under Uncertainty

This session focused on the potential of simulation games to address challenges in decision making (DM) under uncertainty, especially concerning future threats. Participants identified notable DM challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and suggested ways gaming could have aided in managing these challenges.

Key points of the discussion included:

1. Decision-making challenges during COVID-19: 
    - Making decisions based on complex, uncertain information.
    - Identifying leading and lagging indicators for better situational awareness.
    - Predicting decisions that might be misinterpreted or misunderstood.
    - Determining the potential severity of the virus for children and the ramifications of school closures.
    - Implementing effective testing and vaccination policies.
    - Balancing personal risk calculations with public health guidelines.

2. Potential role of gaming:
    - Games could simulate different scenarios to help decision-makers process complex information and predict possible impacts.
    - Gaming could aid in distilling relevant data streams, reducing information complexity, and enhancing situational awareness.
    - Games could help understand and prevent potential misinterpretations or misunderstandings.
    - Using epidemiological models in games could communicate how potential interventions might play out, aiding in policy decision-making and implementation.
    - Games could expose the weaknesses in the implementation of control structures.
    - Gaming could help in risk calculation and general public decision-making.

3. Gaps and research directions:
    - Games need to be designed to consider long-distance connections and non-evident interdependencies in human social systems, like supply chains.
    - Gaming should factor in the difference between policy recommendations/mandates and cultural norms, modeling heterogeneity of responses.
    - Games should also explore the potential conflicts between the objectives/loss functions of participants.
    - The usefulness of games beyond their capacity to be a forum for discussion generally needs to be evaluated.

In conclusion, games have the potential to enhance decision-making in the face of uncertainty by simulating various scenarios and providing a platform for discussion and learning. However, further research is needed to fill the gaps in our understanding of the effectiveness of 'gaming for DM'.
